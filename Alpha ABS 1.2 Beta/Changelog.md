This build based on new Core scripts. In this regard, many changes have been made. The most interesting of them:
  - Now all standard image files are built into the code. Folder img\ABS is no longer needed. Only .js file.
  - *Settings.js file also no longer needed*. All the plugin parameters in plugin .js file
  - New controls key binding system (more compatible with other plugins)
  - Some parts of the plugin have been moved into the another .js files (extensions). They can be optionally connected with the plugin (below main plugin file)
